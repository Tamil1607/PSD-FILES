<caption>Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan:</caption><br><br>
<center><img src="shah.jpg" width="400",height="400"></center><br><br>
<p>Shah Jahan is the 5th Mughal emperor, coming after Bâbur, Humâyûn, Akbar, and Jahângîr, his father. His mother was Princess Nûr Jahân, a woman who had taken power over her husband during the last years of his reign, at a time when he had fallen into the grip of drugs. Born January 5, 1592 in Lahore, he died on January 22, 1666 in Agra at the age of 74 years. He is known as Shah Jahân, sometimes spelled Shah Jehan, but his official name is Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Shah Jahan.

<br>The first years of Shah Jahan, years in which he was known as Prince Khurram, saw the young man receive a refined and cultivated education. He studied a large number of disciplines and became a specialist in martial arts. He surprised his world by taking an interest in architecture. An anecdote is told that he himself built his quarters in the Fort of Kabul, but also by proposing various internal arrangements to the fort of Agra.</p><br>

<h2>Other structures built by Shah Jahan</h2>
<pre><h3>The following monuments were also constructed by Shah Jahan during his rule:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle";>
<li>Red Fort or Lal Quila (Delhi)</li>
<li>Sections of the Agra Fort</li>
<li>Jama Masjid (Delhi)</li>
<li>Moti Masjid or Pearl Mosque (Lahore)</li>

<li>Sections of the Lahore Fort (Lahore)</li>
<li>Jahangir Mausoleum</li>
<li>Takht-e-Taus</li>
<li>Shahjahan Mosque (Thatta)</li>
</pre>

<p>Shah Jahan became seriously ill in September 1658. During his days of recovery, Dara Shikoh, one of his sons, assumed the role of the ruler. This made his brothers furious and almost immediately, Shuja and Murad Baksh sought independent provinces and claimed their rightful share. Meanwhile, Aurangzeb had formed an army of his own and went on to defeat his brother Dara Shikoh. He then killed rest of the contenders and declared himself as the emperor. Though Shah Jahan later recovered from his illness,   Aurangzeb deemed him unfit to rule and imprisoned him in the citadel of Agra.<br> He also imprisoned his sister Jahanara Begum Sahib who wanted to stay with her father in order to take care of him. Shah Jahan is said to have spent eight long years of his imprisonment by staring at the tomb of his beloved wife-the marvel that he built in her memory.<br>

<h3> Info about Taj Mahal: </h3>
<p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the world’s most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

History of construction<br>
Shah Jahān<br>
Taj Mahal mausoleum and mosque
Discover the story behind Shah Jahān's decision to build the Taj Mahal mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Maḥal
The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.
<p>A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to house his own remains. That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been connected by a bridge to the Taj Mahal. He was deposed in 1658 by his son Aurangzeb, however, and was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra Fort.
Resting in the middle of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white marble that reflects hues according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight. It has four nearly identical facades, each with a wide central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners incorporating smaller arches. The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) at the tip of its finial, is surrounded by four lesser domes. The acoustics inside the main dome cause the single note of a flute to reverberate five times. The interior of the mausoleum is organized around an octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief carvings and semiprecious stones (pietra dura). Therein are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān. Those false tombs are enclosed by a finely wrought filigree marble screen. Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true sarcophagi. Standing gracefully apart from the central building, at each of the four corners of the square plinth, are elegant minarets.</p>
<p><ul type="square"><li>Abdul Hamid Lahauri, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb. The current name for the Taj Mahal is believed to be derived from the Persian تاج محل tāj mahall, meaning "crown"</li></p>
<li>The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653. ...
The architecture of the Taj Mahal is a combination of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles of architecture.
The name of the architect of the Taj Mahal is Ahmed Lahauri.
The Taj Mahal was Shah Jahan’s imagination of Mumtaz’s home in paradise</li></ul>
<ul><li>It took 20 years and 20,000 workers to build.</li></ul> 
<ul><li>1,000 elephants were used to transport the building materials to Agra.</li></ul><br>
