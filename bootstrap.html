For example, it is impossible for the people in this decade to live with a wired telephone placed on the table.

Any machine or device we see around us is the product of modern technology. It made things way easier than we could ever imagine.</li>

<td>3.3 million years ago</td>
<td>Stones used as knives</td>
<td>The history of technology begins even before the beginning of our own species. Sharp flakes of stone used as knives and larger unshaped stones used as hammers and anvils have been uncovered at Lake Turkana in Kenya. The tools were made 3.3 million years ago and thus were likely used by an ancestor such as Australopithecus.

<td>1044</td>
<td>Compass</td>
<td>The first definitive mention of a magnetic compass dates from a Chinese book finished in 1044. It describes how soldiers found their way by using a fish-shaped piece of magnetized iron floating in a bowl of water when the sky was too cloudy to see the stars

<td>Johennes Gutenberg completed the printing of the Bible, which was the first book printed in the West using movable type. Gutenberg’s printing press led to an information explosion in Europe.</td>

<tr class="active">
<td>1826/27</td>
<td>Photography</td>
<td>Nicephore Niepce had the great idea to use his solution to make a copy of an image in a camera obscura (a room or box with a small hole in one end through which an image of the outside is projected). In 1826 or 1827, he made an eight-hour-long exposure of the courtyard of his house, the first known photograph.
</td></tr>
<tr class="info">
<td>1927</td>
<td>Television</td>
<td>After the development of radio, the transmission of an image was the next logical step. Early television used a mechanical disk to scan an image. As a teenager in Utah, Philo T. Farnsworth became convinced that a mechanical system would not be able to scan and assemble images multiple times a second. Only an electronic system would do that. In 1922 the 16-year-old Farnsworth worked out a plan for such a system, but it wasn’t until 1927 that he made the first electronic television transmission, a horizontal line. </td>
 </td></tr>
 <tr class="active">
 <td> 1974</td>
 <td>Internet</td>
 <td>Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn produced the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which describes how data can be broken down into smaller pieces called packets and how these packets can be transmitted to the right destination. TCP/IP became the basis for how data is transmitted over the Internet.
 </td></tr>
 <tr class="warning">
 <td>2017</td>
 <td>Artificial Intelligence</td>
 <td>The team behind the AlphaGo artificial intelligence program announced that it had become the world’s best go player. Go is a game with very simple rules but many possible positions. The previous year AlphaGo had defeated the great player Lee Sedol in a match 4–1. AlphaGo then played itself and, through continual improvement, was able to defeat the version that had defeated Lee, 100–0. Through machine learning, AlphaGo had become better at the game than any human.
